# Walmart Goback

The project is explained in the
[front-end repository](https://github.com/Jeansidharta/walmart-goback-frontend)

## The Router

This code is responsible for actually finding the best route for a goback cart.
This problem is analogous to the
[Travelling Salesman Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem).

This project is compiled to WASM and used directly by the front-end.
